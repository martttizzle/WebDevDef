    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT TERMS</h1>
    <h2><strong>AJAX</strong><p></h2><p>AJAX-Short for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML."<br><br> Is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.<br><br>Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>SASS</strong></h2>
    <p>Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar to Haml.[4] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.</p>
    
    
    <h2><strong>WORD PRESS</strong></h2> 
    <p>WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.[4] To function, WordPress has to be installed on a web server, which would either be part of an Internet hosting service or a network host in its own right. An example of the first scenario may be a service like WordPress.com, for example, and the second case could be a computer running the software package WordPress.org.[5] A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. WordPress was used by more than 27.5% of the top 10 million websites as of February 2017.[6] WordPress is reportedly the most popular website management or blogging system in use on the Web,[7] supporting more than 60 million websites.[8]<BR>WordPress has a web template system using a template processor. Its architecture is a front controller, routing all requests for non-static URIs to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable permalinks.[11]</p>
    
   <h2><strong>jQUERY</strong></h2> 
   <p> jQuery is a DOM manipulation library that makes it easier to use JavaScript on your website. JavaScript is the language of choice for making webpages dynamic and interactive. jQuery takes the complex code that would   be required to make AJAX calls or manipulate the DOM and wraps them into simple methods you can call with a single line of JavaScript. <br><br>
       Here are some of the key technical features that are available in the jQuery library:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
    <li>CSS manipulation</li>
    <li>AJAX/JSONP</li>
    <li>Event handling</li>
    <li>Effects and animations</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
    <li>Lightweight (minified and gzipped)</li>
</ul>
<p>Query makes no assumptions about your web technology stack, and may be used in conjunction with other frameworks, including AngularJS. In fact, AngularJS is built off of an implementation of jQuery called jqLite.
Since jQuery has no real structure, the developer has full freedom to build projects as they see fit. However the lack of structure also means it’s easier to fall into the trap of “spaghetti code,” which can lead to confusion on larger projects with no clear design direction or code maintainability. For these situations, a framework like AngularJS can be a big help.</p>
