     <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT TERMS</h1>
    <h2>What does a Back-End Developer do?</h2>
    <p>The back end runs a website—the user doesn’t see it or interact with it, but it is always running in the background, delivering functionality and a desktop-like experience. Back-end developers play a critical role in web development teams, and make sure that data or services requested by the front end system or software are delivered.<br></p>

    <p>The back end is the combination of a database and software written in a server-side language, which is run on web servers, cloud-based servers, or a hybrid of both.<strong> In order to make the server, application, and database communicate with each other</strong>, back-end developers use languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net to build an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it to the user in front end code.<br></p>

<p>After communicating with a business owner and understanding what their needs and technical requirements are, back-end developers use the aforementioned tools to create web applications with clean, well-documented code. They come up with the most effective and efficient solutions for engineering technology by converting and returning data into front end code a user can interact with, such as: filling out a form, creating a profile, shopping online, etc.</p>
   
    <h2> Responsibilities of a back-end developer can include working with:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Database creation, integration, and management</li>
        <li>Back-end frameworks to build server-side software</li>
        <li>Web server technologies</li>
        <li>Cloud computing integration</li>
        <li>Server-side programming languages</li>
        <li>Operating systems</li>
        <li>Content management system development, deployment, and maintenance</li>
        <li>API integration</li>
        <li>Security settings and hack prevents</li>
        <li>Reporting—generating analytics and statistics</li>  
        <li>Backup and restore technologies for a website’s files and DB</li>
    </ul>


     </ol>
    <h2><strong>AJAX</strong></h2>
    <p>AJAX-Short for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML."<br><br> Is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.<br><br>Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>SASS</strong></h2>
    <p>Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar to Haml.[4] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.</p>
    
    
    <h2><strong>WORD PRESS</strong></h2> 
    <p>WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.[4] To function, WordPress has to be installed on a web server, which would either be part of an Internet hosting service or a network host in its own right. An example of the first scenario may be a service like WordPress.com, for example, and the second case could be a computer running the software package WordPress.org.[5] A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. WordPress was used by more than 27.5% of the top 10 million websites as of February 2017.[6] WordPress is reportedly the most popular website management or blogging system in use on the Web,[7] supporting more than 60 million websites.[8]<br>WordPress has a web template system using a template processor. Its architecture is a front controller, routing all requests for non-static URIs to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable permalinks.[11]</p>
    
   <h2><strong>jQUERY</strong></h2> 
   <p> jQuery is a DOM manipulation library that makes it easier to use JavaScript on your website. JavaScript is the language of choice for making webpages dynamic and interactive. jQuery takes the complex code that would   be required to make AJAX calls or manipulate the DOM and wraps them into simple methods you can call with a single line of JavaScript. <br><br>
       Here are some of the key technical features that are available in the jQuery library:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
    <li>CSS manipulation</li>
    <li>AJAX/JSONP</li>
    <li>Event handling</li>
    <li>Effects and animations</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
    <li>Lightweight (minified and gzipped)</li>
</ul>

<p>Query makes no assumptions about your web technology stack, and may be used in conjunction with other frameworks, including AngularJS. In fact, AngularJS is built off of an implementation of jQuery called jqLite.
Since jQuery has no real structure, the developer has full freedom to build projects as they see fit. However the lack of structure also means it’s easier to fall into the trap of “spaghetti code,” which can lead to confusion on larger projects with no clear design direction or code maintainability. For these situations, a framework like AngularJS can be a big help.</p> 

<h2>JSON</h2>
        
<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>
        
    <h2>JSON is built on two structures:</h2>

<li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.</li>
<li>An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.</li>
<li>These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.</li>

<p>In JSON, they take on these forms:</p>

<p>An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace). <br>Each name is followed by : (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by , (comma).</p>
        
        
        <h2>Exchanging Data</h2>
<p>When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.
This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.</p>        
        
        
<h2>Convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string, and send it to the server.</h2>

  
<p>
var myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" };<br>
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);<br>
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON; 
</p>
        

    <h1>MEAN Stack</h1>
   <p>Why MEAN Stack?</p>
   <p>The acronym "MEAN" stands for "MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js" and represents a group of technologies which are known to synergize well together. The major benefit of the MEAN stack is that it's extremely quick to prototype with. Node.js allows you to use Javascript on the backend as well as the frontend which can save you from having to learn a separate language. In addition, the NoSQL nature of MongoDB allows you to quickly change and alter the data layer without having to worry about migrations, which is a very valuable attribute when you're trying to build a product without clear specifications. Finally, these technologies have a lot of community support behind them so finding answers to questions or hiring help is going to be much easier using these technologies.</p>

<p>What is the difference between Apache and node.js?</p>

<p>Apache and Nginx are both HTTP servers. They can serve static files like (.jpg and .html files) or dynamic pages (like a Wordpress blog or forum written in a language like PHP or Python). Apache/nginx need to be configured to recognize the URLs that users will be requesting and route them to the right place.<br>

<br>So, for example, with a typical PHP site (like a Wordpress blog) you tell Apache that any file that ends with .php should be interpreted as PHP code, so when the user visits "http://myblog.com/tag.php?q=mytag", for example, Apache will launch the PHP interpreter to read the file and process it into an HTML page. As part of this process, PHP may talk to a MySQL database and use that to generate the page. Lastly, PHP gives the final HTML code to Apache to send to the user's browser.<br><br>

    So, far so good?<br><br>

Now, Node is a bit different. It's a programming environment like PHP that lets you talk to database, make dynamic pages, etc. However, it differs in that <strong>it includes an HTTP server.</strong>  That means that it can actually act completely on its own without nginx or Apache. You can just run Node and it will be the HTTP server and also the "app server" (which actually creates your dynamic pages and talks to the DB).

It's a two for one deal.

Last thing to know is that when people actually deploy Node on the internet, they sometimes put another HTTP server like nginx in front of Node. That means that when a user loads a page, it first hits Nginx which can make a decision about where to route the request. This is handy if you have a big site and need to run many Node instances to handle all your traffic. This way, the single nginx server can split the work to be done among many Node.js "app servers".</p>

<h2>Node.js</h2>   
 
<li>Node.js is an open source server framework</li>
<li>Node.js is free</li>
<li>Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
<li>Node.js uses JavaScript on the server</li>
    
  <h1>Here is how Node.js handles a file request:</h1>
   <ol>
       <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
       <li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
       <li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client</li>
       <p>Node.js elimintates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.<br>Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.</p>
   </ol>
   <p>What can Node.js Do?</p>
       <ol>
           <li>Node.js cna generate dynamic page content</li>
           <li>Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the serverli</li>
           <li>Node.js can collect form data</li>
           <li>Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database</li>
       </ol>
   <p>What is a Node.js File?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events</li>
        <li>A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server</li>
        <li>Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect</li>
        <li>Node.js files have extension ".js"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Server generally has two meanings:<br>


<li>A piece of software that listens for network requests and then responds to them.<br></li>
<li>A computer running such a piece of software.<br></li>
    <p>A <strong>Node.JS</strong> server can be either of those.<br></p>

<li>In web programming, a Node.JS server takes the place of Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Scala, etc. (And like those<br> other languages, Node.JS lets you use JavaScript for non-server and non-web purposes).</li>
